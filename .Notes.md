# Uploading plant:

The Add Plant button on the "me" page opens a modal with <AddPlant /> as the body. The "input" selects the file and the "upload" calls the functions:

## Inside post_plant.js

post_plant(): uploads to cloudinary. The response if the upload succeeds, is passed on to another function as send_to_server(response.data.public_id, response.data.url, token). This function is also in charge of reloading page.

send_to_server(): sends data to server in order to create the mongoDB documents for a plant and to link it to its owner. The format of the axios request is critical for a 200 response:

> axios.post("url", null, {
> headers: {
> Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
> },
> params: query_params,
> })
